# expeDITA
expeDITA is a PHP-based framework for live management and publishing of DITA resources on the Web. It represents the single-database model of directly-maintained, publishable content rather than the more conventional build/publish model based on separate source/result workflows. Think of it as "DITA for Web sites."

Note that it will take time to fully populate this project. The road map is to start off with the minimal shell that currently drives the any2DITA plugin project. This minimal shell already includes the plugin system and the theming system.

Other components to be added to make this a full system will include a RESTful router/dispatching system, API interfaces, authentication/membership system, commenting system, editor integration system, a tumblelog mode, system utilities (uploader, admin tools, basic content management), some workflow capabilities (basic review/release/disposition), a site localization system, and (hopefully not as an afterthought) documentation.

DITA has often been considered for live use, but the available tools up until lately were still predicated on the conventionl tech-comm publishing process. DITA is not limited to that role, but few tools have been available to allow DITA uptake at the very low end of Web publishing. expeDITA is my attempt to enable users whose needs could normally be met by a simple WordPress site to have the same capability but with real DITA content and a DITA-aware publishing engine at its heart, able to integrate with larger publishing strategies as needed.

And as of fall 2016, the expeDITA Framework is now powering its information and documentation site, [expeDITA.info](http://expedita.info). Follow project announcements on Twitter at [@expeditaNotes](http://twitter.com/expeditanotes).
